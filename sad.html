        <h3>My Journey</h3>
        <p>
            This course taught me collaboration and team work, how to manage a team
            and how to define a work flow for completing tasks. This course was heavily
            based on collaboration, not only with assigned group members but with stakeholders.
            We were required to actually identify a company, make contact with them and conduct
            interviews to understand what they wanted to accomplish. This course taught me of the
            importance of having a planned schedule. It exposed me to the teamwork required to
            accomplish IT projects from the initial phases of even gaining approval to the closing
            which ensured that the objective was met.
        </p>

            Listening skills, communication skills, oral skills, and critical thinking skills were
            the main soft skills which I developed from taking this course. In order to succeed in
            this course these were ultimately mandatory, considering the number of persons and ideas
            it involved, it heavily focused on collaboration and coordination. The requirements set by
            the stake holders also developed my critical thinking skills, especially when the database
            was required to be developed. Understanding what needs to be stored and the logical process
            it should go through to be stored it very important otherwise there could be major errors
            when testing with the code.
        </p>

            The final project which was created from this course was a scheduling system.
            This system is suppose to allow the end user to record customer details and assign them
            to a loans officer who would then assign an appointment date. This system also provides
            reports for management In order to capture the number of appointments being made, what
            products are being applied for, and the productivity of their loans officers. This project
            was done entirely in Microsoft access. I would have preferred to use object oriented programming
            however being the group leader means realizing the skills of your members and this project required
            too much for just one use to develop the code so I went with the better option based on the skills
            of my team.
