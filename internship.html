        <h3>Tasks and Company</h3>
        <p>
           I was assigned to The Ministry of Education and Innovation of 
           The Government of St Lucia for a period of 160 hours. My assigned 
           duties were focused on hardware and networking. This would be inclusive
           of troubleshooting computers and laptops, replacing parts, and installing
           an operating system. As for the networking aspect I mainly configured access
           points.

        <h4>Reflection</h4>
        <p>
            This experience was not only about the technical aspect, however it focused
            on my abilities to work in a team. I was engaging with all my colleagues,
            I gave recommendations when necessary and I also took the opportunity to
            learn from my colleagues. After this experience I can understand why
            our program strongly focuses on team work because I observed how
            the current team worked and even if they were a team the worked
            individually instead of a unit. However when I showed a few of them
            what we can accomplish if we shared the roles they agreed and took my
            recommendation which ultimately reduced the time spent on that task.
            This experience also improved my communication skills, asking more questions
            and better advising not only my colleagues but giving the manager a better
            perspective on current issues.

            During this period my troubleshooting skills also got better. Having me work with legacy devices
            and testing the electrical components gave me a better understanding of what to expect when testing.
            It also taught me how to be innovative when supplies are limited. The internship experience gave
            me an opportunity to test some of my networking skills which I have not had a chance to do due to
            time constraints and made me realized how I have improved.
