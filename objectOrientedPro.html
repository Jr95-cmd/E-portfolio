        <h3>My Journey</h3>
        <p>
            This course taught me the fundamentals of object oriented programming.
            This included understanding the syntax such as how to go about creating
            variables. It also taught me about the data types, which is crucial when
            defining variables or understanding what type of variable can be stored
            in the matched data type. If one does not pay attention to this then this
            can cause a great number of errors which can prevent the code from being
            compiled. I also learned a new programming language which was python,
            the installation process as well as the integrated development environment
            recommended for use with this language.
        </p>
        <p>
            This course improved my thought process when developing projects, not only in
            terms of programming but in general. Before taking this course I simply looked
            at a project as a single entity which proved to be more challenging. However,
            I now view projects as multiple entities by segregating them in various tasks.
            This made me get a clearer picture of the problem at hand and what I was trying to achieve.
            Another important aspect I learnt was that one must read and understand how the programming
            language works and what is should be used for before deciding to simply create the code.
            I also developed the soft skills of conflict resolution due to this course considering that
            it did entail a group project which paired me with a nonresponsive member.
        </p>
        <p>
            The final project for this course basically required students to design a graphical interface
            in python with the use of either the Tkinter library or the Turtle library which are two
            graphical based libraries offered by python. The requirement was to design a hangman
            game which should populate the hangman image after each wrong answer or indicate winner
            if the user makes the correct guess. This also required that the student make the options
            of clickable qwerty keyboard and an input field which I successfully completed both.
            I am uncertain whether anyone else was able to get the two options to work but from what
            I saw majority was only able to create it with the buttons.  This took quite the thought
            process to work the way I intended and I was quite pleased with the end result.
