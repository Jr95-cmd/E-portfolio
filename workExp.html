        <h4>Reflection</h4>
        <p>
            I not only gained technical skills from my work experience but financial knowledge.
            This is key in an IT related field, having both technical skills and an understanding
            of finance. I have always been able to manage money and when undertaking IT projects
            managing finances becomes crucial considering the expense of running those projects.
            It is also important to understand that acquiring the most current technology is
            not always the best measure, however working within a budget and being able to
            meet requirements are crucial. My years experience as a teller has proven that I can
            be trusted when it comes to finance. My checks and balances are always precise and account
            for all spending. Being a teller also developed my customer relationship skills which
            is quite useful in the IT field, understanding your end users and how to relay information
            to them is key. This is one reason why I have great communication skills and I always
            pay attention to how I approach situations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Working in IT well at least my experience shows that a lot of firms are dependent on vendors
            which is why it is crucial to create and maintain good relationships with vendors. This experience
            also made me realize why I would want to work in an IT related company. I honestly prefer to be the
            one in control of the work and this also gives you the opportunity to become a professional in that
            field. I have always been determined to specialize myself in a particular area of focus but this
            has exposed me to quite the number of fields in IT which is quite useful and I am thankful.
            It also has its limitations such as not being able to specialize in one area since you are
            required to focus on a variety of tasks and constantly have to be reaching out to vendors. I have gained
            quite a bit of knowledge in the few years I transitioned to the IT field and I would be an asset to
            any place of employment, considering that I got promoted in such a short period should make it clear
            that I have set high aspirations for my career and intend on seeing them through.
