        <h3>My Journey</h3>
        <p>
            Another major group-based course which centralizes on teamwork and collaboration.
            This course is not only dependent on teamwork, but it is set up in a manner where
            two different majors intersect which can cause a bit of confusion for most. The 
            goal of this course is to create a working solution for a company, this must
            include a networking aspect as well as the software aspect. It heavily focuses 
            on planning and setting targets. I was the leader for my group, and it was my
            task to figure out the strength of my colleagues and assign them roles based on
            that. I was also required to do a lot of future planning in order to ensure that
            everyone was aware of what should be happening and who should be pursuing certain
            tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Undertaking this course certainly improved my collaboration skills as well as my
            planning skills. Although it did help with my technical skills, but it was strongly
            focused on building soft skills, because in order to deliver this project you are 
            required to have people skills and leadership skills. It taught me how to realize 
            when someone is struggling and how to quickly address the situation so they can 
            complete their tasks on time.
        </p>
        <p>
            The project was centered around using various technologies such as networking, databases,
            and development skills. It also required me to do a lot of analytical thinking to understand
            how my team would go about completing the required deliverables. I particularly gained
            experience using SQL server because my main role was assigned to the development of the database.
