        <h3>My Journey</h3>
        <p>
            The objective of this course was to provide students with the necessary knowledge
            in undertaking a project. It guides students in understanding each step of the project
            and its requirements. The course also focused on the use of standards set by the Project
            Management Institute which we should put into practice when undertaking projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            During the duration of this course, I learnt several new terms and processes. I learnt
            about project constraints and how each may affect the project. This course also taught
            me about the project management knowledge areas and the financial aspect of a project
            such as net present value and return on investment and even the payback period. These
            financial aspects truly determine whether a project should be undertaken or whether funds
            should be invested elsewhere.
        </p>
        <p>
            This course was also focused on teamwork and collaboration and required us to present a final
            group project based on what was taught to us. I would normally try to be the group leader, it
            has never been a case where I avoid the responsibility but considering the circumstances at the
            time being the leader of our capstone project, being the leader of this one was just not feasible.
            I gave my complete support to the designated leader and ensured that all my tasks were completed in
            a timely manner.
