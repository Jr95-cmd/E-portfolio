        <h3>My Journey</h3>
        <p>
            The objective of this course is to empower students with technical
            and theoretical skills in order to ensure that their networks are secure.
            This course focused on the use of SANS institute (Sysadmin Audit Network and Security)
            to outline policies that should be in place to ensure that an organization maintains a
            standard for technological security. The course also taught us about cyber threats which
            are being used to attack networks and what should be done to mitigate risks of such attacks.
        </p>
        <p>
            This course made me aware of current policies that are put in place and why they are being enforced.
            Understanding the reasoning behind enforcing a policy makes it a lot easier for someone to uphold it.
            People tend to not pay attention if there are not repercussions for their actions so if they do not
            understand why it is being done then it may seem like it should not exist. In addition to that this
            course exposed me to some techniques which can be used to mitigate cyber-attacks and how those tools work.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the end of this course, we were tasked with developing our own policy for an organization based on
            the contents of its network architecture. We were tasked with using standard policy types set by the 
            SANS institute, which we would then have to select from a range based on what pertained to our selected
            organization. I actually did this based on where I worked and used policies that have not been set but do 
            apply to current technologies being used in the environment. This course taught me how to outline required
            policies of a network to ensure that it complies with standards set by SANS, which would ultimately ensure that
            the organization passes its auditing checks in relation to IT.
