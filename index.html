                    An Individual with a huge interest in programming.
                    At first it was not something I wanted to try however
                    the Monroe college Journey showed that it was one of
                    my strenghts.When it pertains to ethics, this attribute
                    is built in me. I tend to respect the views of everyone
                    and I am always willing to help with issues that I can
                    provide assitance with. Time may be against me however
                    I would still try. I also have outstanding customer
                    service skills considering that this was required by
                    my first official job and it just grew to be part of me
                    My other interests besides technology is exercising and
                    spending time with family.

                    My goal is to become a software developer. I know this is not fast
                    and steady path. However I am making the necessary efforts to make
                    it a reality. I have acquired resources to help me pursue this goal
                    and in addition to that I have constantly been practing. In addition
                    I have also taken interest in cyber security and I intend on it being
                    the next major certificate I persue. IT has many feilds but I have
                    already slimmed it down to what I want to do. I also enjoy learning
                    new aspects, as difficult as they may be but I do believe that
                    with enough effort it can be achieved. Goal oriented, respectful,
                    engaging, anything is possible, this is Edwin Charlery.
