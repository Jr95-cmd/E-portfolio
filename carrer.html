            My IT career actually started from 2019. During this period, I pursued the CompTIA A+
            certification. This required me to participate in both an instructor-led class and going
            through the study guide. This took a period of 3 months, and I was successful in the certification
            exam. After completing the program, I then began a bachelor's degree in computer information systems.
            Initially I wanted to pursue cyber security and networking to avoid programming, however it turned out
            that I was exceptional at programming. While pursuing my degree I also took on a Linux certification
            to gain some knowledge and skill in another operating system. In 2020 I applied for a help desk position
            and I was successful. After two years my employer recognized my skills both technical and soft skills
            and recommended me for a promotion which I was successful. During that period, I have also been partaking
            in programming classes to enhance my skills.
